This is a bot I created to make scarpet scripts which spawn bots on WaveTech.
- The bot takes 3 inputs:
- > Farm Name
- > /player spawn command (ie /player alex spawn at 100 100 100 facing 0 0 in minecraft:overworld)
- > /player action command (ie /player alex use interval 10)
- Some basic features like preventing whitelisted players from being added
- Names must match in both commands.
- Doesn't Check the syntax of the whole command
- Definetly has some bugs too

If you have a farm you would be able to place the script that this outputs into your scripts folder (carpet mod) 
and run it in game instead of copying and pasting the script from a discord channel or notes
